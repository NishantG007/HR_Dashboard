## About the Project
This project focuses on creating a descriptive HR dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard utilises a random sample dataset of HR information for a company to track key metrics like attrition, average age, average salary, and headcount. It visualizes these metrics with interactive charts and tables, providing valuable insights into the company's workforce dynamics.

## Objectives
- To create an interactive and descriptive HR dashboard using Power BI.
- To calculate and display metrics like attrition, average age, average salary, and headcount.
- To visualise HR data with charts, including headcount by department, headcount by age, cumulative headcount, and attrition by date of hire.
- To provide a drop-down menu for sorting and filtering the HR data.
- To add a drill-through feature for deeper analysis of specific data points.

## Dataset Source
